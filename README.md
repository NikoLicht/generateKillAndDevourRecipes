# generateKillAndDevourRecipes
A persons attempt at generating stupid recipes, using scraping and a neural network.

I've been facinated with a Danish tv-show called 'Nak og Ã†d' (Kill and Devour), where a famous TV-chef and a huntsman goes into the wilderness and catch / kill animals and cook them.
Often the ingredients are rather bizzare, which is what i have tried to capture in this little project. The project is based on the recipes from the tv show, which are publicly available.
